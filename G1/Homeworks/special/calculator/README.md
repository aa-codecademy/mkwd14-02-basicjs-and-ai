- The calculator should have buttons for the numbers to click (just like calculators in real life, no inputs!).
- It should have buttons for the operations: Sum, Subtract, Multiply and Divide.
- It should also have the standard buttons equals, decimal dot and reset ( C ).
- There should be a display where we can see the numbers that we are entering and results (like calculators in real life).
- The calculator should show error message if number is too large or if we are dividing by zero.

**NOTE:** The eval() function is not allowed!
