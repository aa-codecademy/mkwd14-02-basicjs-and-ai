### 🧠 Using AI Tools for Your Homework

You are allowed and it is recommended to use AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) while working on this homework — **but as support**, not as the main problem-solver.

Before asking AI for help:

1. **Think about the solution yourself first.**  
   Try to understand the problem and outline how *you* would approach it.

2. **Be critical about AI suggestions.**  
   AI can make mistakes or oversimplify. Don’t copy code blindly.

3. **Check all scenarios.**  
   Make sure your solution works not only for the “happy path” but also for edge cases.

4. **Think about negative cases.**  
   What happens if the input is wrong? If the API fails? If the user does something unexpected?

5. **Understand the code you submit.**  
   You will be asked to explain your solution — you should know *why* it works.

AI is a tool, not a replacement for your own thinking.  
Use it wisely and enjoy learning! 💡
