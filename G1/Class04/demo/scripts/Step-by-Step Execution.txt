Step-by-Step Execution
Initialization:

let index = 0; initializes the index variable to 0. This variable keeps track of the current position in the daysOfWeek array.
Condition Check:

The while loop checks the condition: index < daysOfWeek.length.
Initially, index = 0 and daysOfWeek.length = 7. Since 0 < 7 is true, the loop proceeds.
First Iteration:

The loop body executes:
console.log(daysOfWeek[index]); prints daysOfWeek[0], which is 'Monday'.
index += 1; increments index to 1.
Second Iteration:

The condition index < daysOfWeek.length is checked again. Now, index = 1 and 1 < 7 is true.
The loop body executes:
console.log(daysOfWeek[1]); prints 'Tuesday'.
index += 1; increments index to 2.
Third Iteration:

The condition index < daysOfWeek.length is checked. Now, index = 2 and 2 < 7 is true.
The loop body executes:
console.log(daysOfWeek[2]); prints 'Wednesday'.
index += 1; increments index to 3.
Fourth Iteration:

The condition index < daysOfWeek.length is checked. Now, index = 3 and 3 < 7 is true.
The loop body executes:
console.log(daysOfWeek[3]); prints 'Thursday'.
index += 1; increments index to 4.
Fifth Iteration:

The condition index < daysOfWeek.length is checked. Now, index = 4 and 4 < 7 is true.
The loop body executes:
console.log(daysOfWeek[4]); prints 'Friday'.
index += 1; increments index to 5.
Sixth Iteration:

The condition index < daysOfWeek.length is checked. Now, index = 5 and 5 < 7 is true.
The loop body executes:
console.log(daysOfWeek[5]); prints 'Saturday'.
index += 1; increments index to 6.
Seventh Iteration:

The condition index < daysOfWeek.length is checked. Now, index = 6 and 6 < 7 is true.
The loop body executes:
console.log(daysOfWeek[6]); prints 'Sunday'.
index += 1; increments index to 7.
Exit Condition:

The condition index < daysOfWeek.length is checked again. Now, index = 7 and 7 < 7 is false.
The loop terminates, and no further iterations occur.
Final Output
The console.log statements produce the following output in the terminal:

Key Concepts
Initialization: The loop starts with index = 0.
Condition: The loop runs as long as index < daysOfWeek.length.
Increment: index += 1 ensures the loop progresses through the array.
Termination: The loop stops when index reaches 7, which is equal to the length of the array.
